This project is based on a text dataset Deceptive Opinion Spam Corpus.

## Understanding the Deceptive Opinion Spam Dataset

The Deceptive opinion spam dataset is a corpus consisting of truthful and deceptive hotel reviews of 20 Chicago hotels. 
The corpus contains:

    400 truthful, positive reviews from TripAdvisor
    400 deceptive positive reviews from Mechanical Turk
    400 truthful, negative reviews from Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline, TripAdvisor, and Yelp
    400 deceptive negative reviews from Mechanical Turk

In total we have 1600 reviews, the task is to classify review either as  truthful or deceptive hotel reviews.

N.B: There is a strong distributional difference between informative and imaginative word,  the former typically consists of more nouns, adjectives, prepositions, determiners, and coordinating conjunctions, while the latter includes more verbs, adverbs, pronouns, and pre-determiners. Deceptive opinions contain more superlatives  since deceptive writing often contains exaggerated language.
